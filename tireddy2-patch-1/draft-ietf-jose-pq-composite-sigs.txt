1.  Introduction

   The impact of a potential Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer
   (CRQC) on algorithms whose security is based on mathematical problems
   such as integer factorisation or discrete logarithms over finite
   fields or elliptic curves raises the need for new algorithms that are
   perceived to be secure against CRQC as well as classical computers.
   Such algorithms are called post-quantum, while algorithms based on
   integer factorisation or discrete logarithms are called traditional.

   While switching from a traditional algorithm to a post-quantum one
   intends to strengthen the security against an adversary possessing a
   quantum computer, the lack of maturing time of post-quantum
   algorithms compared to traditional algorithms raises uncertainty
   about their security.

   Thus, the joint use of a traditional algorithm and a post-quantum
   algorithm in protocols represents a solution to this problem by
   providing security as long as at least one of the traditional or
   post-quantum components remains secure.

   This document describes JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and
   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) serializations for hybrid
   composite signatures.  The composite algorithms described combine ML-
   DSA as the post-quantum component and either ECDSA or EdDSA as the
   traditional component.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document follows the terminology for post-quantum hybrid schemes
   defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   This section recalls some of this terminology, but also adds other
   definitions used throughout the whole document:

   "Asymmetric Traditional Cryptographic Algorithm": An asymmetric
   cryptographic algorithm based on integer factorisation, finite field
   discrete logarithms, elliptic curve discrete logarithms, or related
   mathematical problems.  A related mathematical problem is one that
   can be solved by solving the integer factorisation, finite field
   discrete logarithm or elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
   Where there is little risk of confusion asymmetric traditional
   cryptographic algorithms can also be referred to as traditional
   algorithms for brevity.

   "Post-Quantum Algorithm": An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that
   is intended to be secure against attacks using quantum computers as
   well as classical computers.  As with all cryptography, it always
   remains the case that attacks, either quantum or classical, may be
   found against post-quantum algorithms.  Therefore it should not be
   assumed that just because an algorithm is designed to provide post-
   quantum security it will not be compromised.

   "Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Scheme": A multi-algorithm
   scheme where at least one component algorithm is a post-quantum
   algorithm and at least one is a traditional algorithm.

   "PQ/T Hybrid Digital Signature": A multi-algorithm digital signature
   scheme made up of two or more component digital signature algorithms
   where at least one is a post-quantum algorithm and at least one is a
   traditional algorithm.

   "Composite Algorithm": An algorithm which is a sequence of two
   component algorithms, as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

   "Component Algorithm": Each cryptographic algorithm that forms part
   of a cryptographic scheme.

3.  Algorithm Key Pair (AKP) Type

   This document makes use of the Algorithm Key Pair (AKP) type which is
   defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium].

   As a reminder, the AKP type is used to express public and private
   keys for use with algorithms.  The parameters for public and private
   keys contain byte strings.

   This document makes use of the serialization routines defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] to obtain the byte string
   encodings of the composite public and private keys.

   The process to compute JWK Thumbprint and COSE Key Thumbprint as
   described in [RFC7638] and [RFC9679] is detailed in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium].

4.  Composite Signature Algorithm

   The structures of the composite keys and composite signatures follow
   an approach similar to [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].  The
   composite design is chosen so that composite keys and signatures can
   be used as a drop-in replacement in JOSE / COSE object formats.  This
   section gives some details about their construction.

4.1.  Composite Key Generation

   Composite public and private keys are generated by calling the key
   generation functions of the two component algorithms and
   concatenating the keys in an order given by the registered composite
   algorithm.

   Composite Public Key <- Public Key of the 1st Algorithm || Public Key
   of the 2nd Algorithm and

   Composite Private Key <- Private Key of the 1st Algorithm || Private
   Key of the 2nd Algorithm

   For the composite algorithms described in this document (ML-DSA with
   ECDSA or EdDSA), the Key Generation process is as follows:

   1. Generate component keys

       mldsaSeed = Random(32)
       (mldsaPK, mldsaSK) = ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal(mldsaSeed)

       (tradPK, tradSK) = Trad.KeyGen()

   2. Check for component key generation failure

       if NOT (mldsaPK, mldsaSK) or NOT (tradPK, tradSK):
           output "Key generation error"

   3. Serialize keys into composite form

       Composite Public Key  <- SerializePublicKey(mldsaPK, tradPK)
       Composite Private Key <- SerializePrivateKey(mldsaSeed, tradSK)

   As in [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs], this keygen routine
   uses the seed-based ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal defined in Algorithm 6 of
   [FIPS.204].

   This document makes use of the serialization routines from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] to obtain the byte string
   encodings of the composite public and private keys.  These encodings
   are then directly used with the AKP Key Type.  For more information,
   see the SerializePublicKey, DeserializePublicKey, SerializePrivateKey
   and DeserializePrivateKey algorithms from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

   Point compression for the ECDSA or EdDSA component is not performed
   for the AKP JSON Web Key Type but can be performed for the AKP COSE
   Key Type.

   In this document, as in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium], the ML-DSA
   private key MUST be a 32-bytes seed.

4.2.  Composite Sign

   When signing a message M with the composite Sign algorithm, the
   signature combiner prepends a prefix as well as a label value
   specific to the composite algorithm used to bind the two component
   signatures to the composite algorithm and achieve weak non-
   separability, as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums].

   However, only the pure ML-DSA component algorithm is used internally.

   A composite signature's value MUST include the two signature
   components and the two components MUST be in the same order as the
   components from the corresponding signing key.

   A composite signature for the message M is generated by:

   *  computing the pre-hash of the message M;

   *  concatenating the prefix, the label, a byte 0x00 and the pre-hash;

   *  encoding the resulting message;

   *  calling the two signature component algorithms on this new
      message;

   *  concatenating the two output signatures.

   For the composite algorithms described in this document (ML-DSA with
   ECDSA or EdDSA), the signature process of a message M is as follows:

1. Compute the Message representative M'

    M' <- Prefix || Label || 0x00 || PH(M)
    M' <- Encode(M')

2. Separate the private key into component keys and re-generate the ML-DSA key from seed

    (mldsaSeed, tradSK) = DeserializePrivateKey(sk)
    (_, mldsaSK) = ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal(mldsaSeed)

3. Generate the two component signatures

    sig_1 <- ML-DSA.Sign(mldsaSK, M', ctx=Label)
    sig_2 <- Trad.Sign(tradSK, M')

4. If either ML-DSA.Sign() or Trad.Sign() return an error, then this process MUST return an error.

    if NOT mldsaSig or NOT tradSig:
      output "Signature generation error"

5. Output the encoded composite signature value.

    CompositeSignature <- SerializeSignatureValue(sig_1, sig_2)
    return CompositeSignature

   The serialization routines from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] are again used to obtain the
   byte string encoding of the composite signature.  The
   SerializeSignatureValue routine simply concatenates the fixed-length
   ML-DSA signature value and the signature value from the traditional
   algorithm.  For more information, see the SerializeSignatureValue and
   DeserializeSignatureValue algorithms from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

   The prefix "Prefix" string is defined as in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] as the byte encoding of the
   string "CompositeAlgorithmSignatures2025", which in hex is
   436F6D706F73697465416C676F726974686D5369676E61747572657332303235.  It
   can be used by a traditional verifier to detect if the composite
   signature has been stripped apart.

   A signature label "Label" is defined in the same way as
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].  It is specific to each
   composite algorithm.  Additionally, the composite label is passed
   into the underlying ML-DSA primitive as the ctx.  Signature Label
   values can be found in Table 4.

   Similarly to [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium] which indicates that the
   ctx parameter MUST be the empty string, the application context
   passed in to the composite signature algorithm MUST be the empty
   string.  To align with the structure of the
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] combiner, the byte 0x00 is
   appended in the message M' after the label to indicate the context
   has length 0.  However, a second non-empty context, defined as the
   label, is passed down into the underlying pure ML-DSA component
   algorithm, to bind the Composite-ML-DSA algorithm used.

   Table 2 (resp. Table 3) indicates the pre-hash algorithms to use for
   JOSE (resp. COSE).

   For JOSE (resp. COSE), M' is base64url-encoded (resp. binary encoded)
   before signature computations.

4.3.  Composite Verify

   The Verify algorithm MUST validate a signature only if all component
   signatures were successfully validated.

   The verification process of a signature sig is as follows:

   *  separate the composite public key into the component public keys;

   *  separate the composite signature into its 2 component signatures;

   *  compute the message M' from the message M whose signature is to be
      verified;

   *  encode the resulting message M';

   *  verify each component signature.

1. Separate the keys and signatures

    (mldsaPK, tradPK) <- DeserializePublicKey(pk)
    (sig_1, sig_2) <- DeserializeSignatureValue(sig)

    If Error during deserialization, or if any of the component keys or signature values are not of the correct type or length for the given component algorithm then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

2. Compute the message representative M'

    M' <- Prefix || Label || 0x00 || PH(M)
    M' <- Encode(M')

3. Check each component signature individually, according to its algorithm specification.

    if NOT ML-DSA.Verify(mldsaPK, M', ctx=Label)
        output "Invalid signature"
    if NOT Trad.Verify(tradPK, M')
        output "Invalid signature"
    if all succeeded, then
        output "Valid signature"

   The DeserializePublicKey and DeserializeSignatureValue serialization
   routines from [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] are used to
   get the component public keys and the component signatures.  For more
   information, see the DeserializePublicKey and
   DeserializeSignatureValue algorithms from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

4.4.  Encoding Rules

   In each combination, the byte streams of the keys and of the
   signatures are directly concatenated.

   Signature of the 1st Algorithm || Signature of the 2nd Algorithm

   Since all combinations presented in this document start with the ML-
   DSA algorithm and the key or signature sizes are fixed as defined in
   [FIPS.204], it is unambiguous to encode or decode a composite key or
   signature.

   Table 1 lists sizes of the three parameter sets of the ML-DSA
   algorithm.

   +===========+====================+=============+========+===========+
   |           | Private Key (seed) | Private     | Public | Signature |
   |           |                    | Key         | Key    | Size      |
   +===========+====================+=============+========+===========+
   | ML-DSA-44 | 32                 | 2560        | 1312   | 2420      |
   +-----------+--------------------+-------------+--------+-----------+
   | ML-DSA-65 | 32                 | 4032        | 1952   | 3309      |
   +-----------+--------------------+-------------+--------+-----------+
   | ML-DSA-87 | 32                 | 4896        | 2592   | 4627      |
   +-----------+--------------------+-------------+--------+-----------+

         Table 1: Sizes (in bytes) of keys and signatures of ML-DSA

   Note that the seed is always 32 bytes, and that ML-
   DSA.KeyGen_internal from [FIPS.204] is called to produce the expanded
   private key from the seed, whose size corresponds to the sizes of the
   private key in the table above.

5.  Composite Signature Instantiations

   The ML-DSA signature scheme supports three possible parameter sets,
   each of which corresponding to a specific security strength.  See
   [FIPS.204] for more considerations on that matter.

   The traditional signature algorithm for each combination in Table 2
   and Table 3 was chosen to match the security level of the ML-DSA
   post-quantum component.

   The [FIPS.204] specification defines both pure and pre-hash modes for
   ML-DSA, referred to as "ML-DSA" and "HashML-DSA" respectively.  This
   document only specifies a single mode which is similar in
   construction to HashML-DSA.  However, because the pre-hashing is done
   at the composite level, only the pure ML-DSA algorithm is used as the
   underlying ML-DSA primitive.

   specific PQ/T combinations to be registered in [IANA.JOSE].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7515], [RFC7517], [RFC9053] and
   [FIPS.204] also apply to this document.

   All security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic
   application must be addressed by JWS/JWK agents.  Protecting the
   user's private key and employing countermeasures to various attacks
   constitute a priority.

   In particular, to avoid key reuse, when generating a new composite
   key, the key generation functions for both component algorithms MUST
   be executed.  Compliant parties MUST NOT use, import or export
   component keys that are used in other contexts, combinations, or by
   themselves as keys for standalone algorithm use.

   For security properties and security issues related to the use of a
   hybrid signature scheme, the user can refer to
   [I-D.draft-ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums].  For more
   information about hybrid composite signature schemes and the
   different hybrid combinations that appear in this document, the user
   can read [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

   In JOSE/COSE, the security objective of digital signatures is to
   ensure that only an authorized signer can produce a valid signature
   over a given protected header and payload.  Verifiers do not rely on
   signature uniqueness, and replay protection is addressed through
   claims defined in [RFC7519], Section 4.1 (e.g., exp, nbf, and jti)
   and in COSE, these correspond to the equivalent claims defined in
   [RFC8392], Section 3.

   Under a CRQC, traditional signature algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA,
   and EdDSA are vulnerable to private-key recovery, enabling attackers
   to forge arbitrary JWS objects or COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 structures and
   fully impersonate the signer.  When Composite ML-DSA is used, a valid
   JOSE/COSE signature requires successful verification of both the ML-
   DSA component and the traditional component.  As a result, an
   adversary that compromises only the traditional algorithm cannot
   produce valid JOSE/COSE objects as long as ML-DSA remains secure.
   This prevents JOSE/COSE signature spoofing and impersonation attacks
   even if the traditional signature component is compromised.

   Furthermore, even if the traditional component algorithm is
   compromised, an attacker cannot spoof the certificate used to sign a
   JOSE/COSE object.  The integrity of the composite public key is
   protected through mandatory validation of the certificate header:

   *  In JOSE: The x5c header as specified in [RFC7515], Section 4.1.6.

   *  In COSE: The x5chain header as specified in [RFC9360],
      Section 3.2.

   These specifications require the validation of the composite
   signature on the certificate itself.  This means the certificate
   itself is protected by a composite signature.  Even if an attacker
   can break the traditional algorithm, they cannot forge a fake
   certificate to swap your public key for theirs, because the ML-DSA
   component of the CA's signature remains secure.

   Composite ML-DSA is not suitable for use cases that require non-
   repudiation or signature uniqueness guarantees.  In the JOSE/COSE
   threat model described above, existential unforgeability under
   chosen-message attack (EUF-CMA) is sufficient to meet the intended
   security goals.  Composite ML-DSA provides EUF-CMA security if at
   least one of its component signature algorithms is EUF-CMA secure and
   the pre-hash function PH is collision resistant.

   When paired with traditional algorithms such as Ed25519 or Ed448,
   which are SUF-CMA secure, the composite construction is SUF-CMA
   secure against classical adversaries.  However, Composite ML-DSA is
   not SUF-CMA secure against quantum adversaries, since a quantum
   adversary can break the SUF-CMA security of the traditional
   component.  Consequently, applications for which SUF-CMA security is
   a strict requirement MUST NOT use Composite ML-DSA.
